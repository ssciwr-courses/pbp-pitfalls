# pbp-code-formatter
Correct the three example files in chapter2_3 using the `flake8` linter. Try formatting the files with the code formatter `black`. Check if `black` finds all issues raised by flake8. Which problems are not resolved by both of them?
Correct the jupyter notebook in the same folder using the appropriate extensions for `flake8` and `black`.

How can you set defaults for your linter and formatter configuration?
